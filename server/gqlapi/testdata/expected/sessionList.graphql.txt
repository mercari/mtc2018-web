The quantum internet operates on a different principle—quantum mechanics—from the internet we have today, on the foundation of entanglement created between two random nodes. Naturally, the quantum internet comes with different advantages. For example, it is the foundation for realizing completely secure cryptography. Furthermore, quantum computers utilize entanglement and superposition to simultaneously handle a mass of states. Due to this feature, quantum memory size is crucial. By connecting quantum computers via telecommunications to conduct distributed quantum computing, we can obtain a higher computing ability. Entanglement is the fundamental physical attribute of quantum mechanics, and therefore is also useful for a variety of scientific experiments. Nagayama will also touch on the current progress of research and development of the quantum internet.

The quantum internet operates on a different principle—quantum mechanics—from the internet we have today, on the foundation of entanglement created between two random nodes. Naturally, the quantum internet comes with different advantages. For example, it is the foundation for realizing completely secure cryptography. Furthermore, quantum computers utilize entanglement and superposition to simultaneously handle a mass of states. Due to this feature, quantum memory size is crucial. By connecting quantum computers via telecommunications to conduct distributed quantum computing, we can obtain a higher computing ability. Entanglement is the fundamental physical attribute of quantum mechanics, and therefore is also useful for a variety of scientific experiments. Nagayama will also touch on the current progress of research and development of the quantum internet.

This scoring system has undergone a series of discussions across our offices in San Francisco (now Palo Alto), Portland, and Tokyo. Now, it’s grown to the point of being included in our company OKR, and we consider it an indispensable metric. In this session, I'll be talking about how the implementation of this metric evolved in the last 12 months, and how it has affected decision-making in our product development.","outlineJa":"US版メルカリでは、一年前からお客様のカスタマーサポート満足度を計測するために、CSAT(Customer Satisfaction) Surveyを実施してスコアを算出しはじめました。このスコアリングは、サンフランシスコ(現パロアルト)/ポートランド/東京の3拠点で議論を重ねて育て続けられ、今ではCompany OKRへ組み込まれるようになり、社内で大切にしているモノサシへと進化しました。そんな私たちのモノサシが、この一年でどのように実装内容が変化していったか、プロダクト開発の意思決定に影響を与えていったかご紹介いたします。","slides":[{"id":"Slide:36","lang":"jp","slideId":36,"url":"https://speakerdeck.com/mercari/mtc2018-csat-score-ji-du-gai-shan-sinasai","speaker":{"name":"Takako Ohshima"}},{"id":"Slide:37","lang":"en","slideId":37,"url":"https://speakerdeck.com/mercari/mtc2018-csat-score-super-improvements-just-do-it","speaker":{"name":"Takako Ohshima"}}],"movies":[{"id":"Movie:22","movieId":22,"url":"https://youtu.be/6k5fFqsL-3E","speaker":{"name":"Takako Ohshima"}}],"lang":"jp","tags":["CRE"],"speakers":[{"id":"Speaker:takako_ohshima","speakerId":"takako_ohshima","name":"Takako Ohshima","nameJa":"大島 孝子","company":"mercari","position":"Software Engineer (Machine Learning)","positionJa":"Software Engineer (Machine Learning)","profile":"Takako Ohshima gained extensive technical experience through the Security Camp and the MITOU program organized by the Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA) during her time as a student, then joined CyberAgent, Inc. after graduating.

The quantum internet operates on a different principle—quantum mechanics—from the internet we have today, on the foundation of entanglement created between two random nodes. Naturally, the quantum internet comes with different advantages. For example, it is the foundation for realizing completely secure cryptography. Furthermore, quantum computers utilize entanglement and superposition to simultaneously handle a mass of states. Due to this feature, quantum memory size is crucial. By connecting quantum computers via telecommunications to conduct distributed quantum computing, we can obtain a higher computing ability. Entanglement is the fundamental physical attribute of quantum mechanics, and therefore is also useful for a variety of scientific experiments. Nagayama will also touch on the current progress of research and development of the quantum internet. We hope this session will give you a chance to think a bit about the future of telecommunications.",

The quantum internet operates on a different principle—quantum mechanics—from the internet we have today, on the foundation of entanglement created between two random nodes. Naturally, the quantum internet comes with different advantages. For example, it is the foundation for realizing completely secure cryptography. Furthermore, quantum computers utilize entanglement and superposition to simultaneously handle a mass of states. Due to this feature, quantum memory size is crucial. By connecting quantum computers via telecommunications to conduct distributed quantum computing, we can obtain a higher computing ability. Entanglement is the fundamental physical attribute of quantum mechanics, and therefore is also useful for a variety of scientific experiments. Nagayama will also touch on the current progress of research and development of the quantum internet. We hope this session will give you a chance to think a bit about the future of telecommunications.",
